Do not go gentle into that good night
Do not go gentle into that good night
Do not go gentle into that good night
Rage, rage against the dying of the light
Rage, rage against the dying of the light
Old age should burn and rave at close of day
Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright
Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight
Though wise men at their end know dark is right
And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way
Because their words had forked no lightning they
Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay
Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight
