Do not go gentle into that good night,
Do not go gentle into that good night.
Do not go gentle into that good night.
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
Old age should burn and rave at close of day;
Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright.
Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,
Though wise men at their end know dark is right,
Because their words had forked no lightning they
And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,
Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight
Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,
Blind eyes could blaze like 4 meteors and be gay, Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
